## Parallax Scrolling
Parallax Scrolling - also known as "Asymmetrical scrolling", is a technique many web developers use to add a 2D scroll effect to web applications. It’s visually appealing without adding additional clutter to your web design layout. In addition, it’s a great way to catch the viewer's eye and add simplistic movement to this static page and create the base to any beautiful web application.
